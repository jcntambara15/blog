This page talks about my experience with the following assignment: [CSCI 340 Lab 3 - Jekyll Styling](https://hendrix-cs.github.io/csci340/labs/jekyllmods.html).

## Challenges

As far as challenges are concerned, I didn't face a lot of challenges or struggles with this lab. Everything was self-explanatory. With that being said, I am really looking forward to what I will learn in the next lab: [JavaScript and jQuery](https://hendrix-cs.github.io/csci340/labs/javascript.html).

## Not Related

I love taking pictures, so though not related to this page, but I wanted to add a few of the pictures I took at the museum of Illusion in Dallas, Texas.
