I love sport, and this page definitely goes into some details about my favorite sports, especially the ones I enjoy the most. 

## Top Three Sports

* Volleyball
* Basketball
* Soccer

## Why the Above Sports?

### Volleyball

Volleyball is number one in my favorite sports. Well, I played volleyball for my high school, but that's not my main point here. I want to mention that volleyball is at least one of the sports that super enjoyable in terms of the joys you get after every spike. Not only just a spike, even when you make a good serve or a very good set, it's the best feeling. On top of the aforementioned things, I would also say that in volleyball, there is really not much of running - and I really really don't enjoy running. 

### Basketball

Basketball is also so much fun, and I do really enjoy it a lot. Whenever I almost dunk on someone, it does make me feel strong and proud. There is also this feeling about being able to make a three point basket like several times consecutively, and it does make a very big difference. However, I hate that I have to run a lot, but it still counts as the best sport. 


### Soccer

Soccer (or Football - as the British people call it) is also so much fun. I love doing several tricks to a person while I approach the opponent's goal post. It's always exciting because it involves a lot of people who are always so passionate about winning. I like playing Soccer OMG!
