### Link to My GitHub Lab 8 Project

[Lab 8: ASP.NET Razor Pages](https://github.com/jcntambara15/csci340lab8/tree/main/RazorPagesMusic)

### The Easiest Parts of the Tutorial

The easiest part of the tutorial was being able to run all the given commands with no troubles. Especially, for the mac users, installing dependencies and other programs can become painful at some point. 


### The Confusing Parts of the Tutorial

The confusing parts was mostly understanding the existing set up because of less familiarity with the programming language involved. There were also some errors I would get while building the project and couldn't know what's going on even after looking the up online. Something like "something used as a namespace when it should be this and this ..." but no quick fix. Other than that, the rest were kinda self explanatory. 


### What Was Difficult to Translate when Creating my own Application

The difficult thing was understanding how to change the name from RazorPagesMovie to something specific to my new application. I had troubles knowing whether my folder should also be called RazorPagesMusic and then modify the rest of the stuff to reflect my application, but things weren't working when I did that. It was hard to customize the application in the beginning until I figured out what the problem was. I had to go back, create a folder with my app's name and made sure that every file in the provided code base has the name of my application and that's when things worked.

### Parallels and Differences between Jekyll framework and the Razor framework

The first thing I noticed as the similarities is the ability to provide input and then get something built for you using the pre-built set up in the framework. They both provide starting point to the user, where the user is able to go in and modify things according to the desired outcome. The differences is that Razor pages changes aren't updated dynamically, there is a need to always rebuild the project for the changes to appear in the browser. For Jekyll, you can just run the server and keep refreshing the browser to view the changes. While Jekyll supports static sites, Razor framework is a great tool that allows the interaction with backend using a database. 

### How Confident Do I Feel Making Another Razor Application?

After a few practices and noticing the pattern, I feel confident enough to create a simple application that, at least, involves a single data model.
