## Ruby Installations

This gave me so much trouble. Starting from yesterday, I followed all the instructions but everything was failing on my Mac M1. I looked up all the error messages, got a million solutions from different sources including github, stack overflow, and many more. However, none of the solutions were working because each of them would produce a new error. It's been crazy, but I finally managed to install RVM, which helped in the end. I got a stack overflow solution and luckily it resolved my troubles. The following are some stack overflow links that helped me: [Stack Overflow Solution 1][stack-overflow1], [Stack Overflow Solution 2][stack-overflow2], [GitHub Solution 1][github], and many others. Of all the suggetions, I think Stack Overflow Solution 2 was more useful that the rest. 

## Familiar Material

Regardless of the troubles in the beginning, the rest of the material is pretty much familiar. I have a very good experience with markdown and another site  generator called Hugo that works pretty much the same way as Jekyll.  So building the site locally, creating different files, creating and adding pieces to the front matter is pretty much understandable. Overall, the set up behind this blog code base is not very complicated compared to the troubles I got while doing the ruby installation. 

### A List of Material I Look Forward to Learning:

* Jekyll shortcodes
    * Ensuring the texts inside the curl braces are rendered
    * The magic behind their work
* The language (ruby) in general
* And a lot of other things
