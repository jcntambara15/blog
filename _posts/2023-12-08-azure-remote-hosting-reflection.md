### Lab 10 Reflection


This lab, for the most part, Thomas couldn't figure out how everyone could see what he was doing. He ran into troubles, and we couldn't proceed until he goes to office hours to get the issues fixed with Dr. Goadrich. Once that was done, my contribution with the team was to all work on Thomas' laptop and complete all the steps in one sitting. The steps that confused us the most was the step that required the migration. Regardless of the fact that all the previously steps were correctly set up, and the parts that were supposed to add the migration folder were set up, we still run into the issue that said the migration folder didn't exist. Also after fixing the issue, I still ran into the issue of link to the azure server not working even when the app was already showing that it's deployed. When clicking on the link, I always got, "no internet" even when connected to the internet. I actually didn't figure out the way to resolve the issue.
