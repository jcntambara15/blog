### The Easiest Parts of the Tutorial

Like the last tutorial, since it's mostly copying and pasting, the easiest part was being able to following through all the given instructions with no troubles. 


### The Confusing Parts of the Tutorial

The confusing parts were mostly about the instructions that said to replace the code with the given code. However, the given code would be incomplete and there is no where they explain what you have to keep from the previous code and what so that things aren't messed up. That would lead to some weird errors that somethings are used but not defined anywhere and would have to revert to the previous code and just try to find what needs to be added and what's not needed. Other than that, the rest were kinda self explanatory. 


### What was difficult about working with multiple tables as opposed to the single table in the previous lab?

Some difficulties were mostly about understanding what's happening at the back under due to lots of information in the tutorial, but other than that I believe everything was self explanatory. I still don't understand how the classes and all the scaffolded files are created when the scaffolding command is run though, I need to read that a little more. Also, I think I just went through the tutorial without paying attention to step 2 of the lab, and I finished the whole tutorial already. It might be hard going through the finished tutorial and trying to modify some things like renaming stuff or adding fields since there are more things involved like migration and more. 

### How prepared do you feel to create your team project now for your client, and what will be different for your situation?

I think it's going to be a matter of having a clear entity relationship model and a very good moqup. Having those, I feel somehow prepared to try to follow the tutorials and create entities as needed. There is going to be a bit of extra work to really understand what's going on and how everything work together because there is a lot involved, but I feel better than how I felt in the previous lab.
