### My  Continued Personal Role

I've been pretty much moderating all the client communications during the meeting so far, making sure that I get the meeting started and explaing how we understand the requirements and asking if they have more things they want us to add or making sure our understand align with what they want. I'm still working on razor pages, creating different forms, managing the CI/CD, setting the Github actions so that there is a smooth way of working with feature branches and the main project branch. I've been reviewing and approving Pull Requests from my team members, and resolving conflicts, directing my teammates on how to create Pull Requests, etc! 

### My Future Plans

My future plans are to keep adding more staff and making sure everyone understands the connection in different things we're putting together.
