### My Personal Role

My role in the project has been ensuring a smooth communication within the team, clarifying the client needs, helping draft the moqups, creating the razor pages, and gathering other requirements!

### My Future Plans

My future plans are to shape the razor pages and make it look nicer by modifying the UI, creating some parts of the database, and making sure everyone is on top of their work.
